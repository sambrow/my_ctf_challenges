    You may have heard about <b>/robots.txt</b> resources.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can read more about them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.
</div>
<br/>
<div>
    In a new browser tab, try to go to the <b>/robots.txt</b> resource of this web app.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can copy the URL from the address bar in this window and use it in a new tab. However, you'll want to delete the singleton <b>/</b> character and everything after it.  Then add <b>/robots.txt</b> onto the end of what is remaining.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    See if you can use what you learn there to obtain the secret text string used to sign JWTs for this app.
</div>
<br/>
<div>
    Onse you have it, go back to your jwt.io tab where you have set <b>isAdmin</b> to <b>true</b> and very carefully click in the editable field in the VERIFY SIGNATURE window.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First clear out ALL of the current text in that window.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Then paste in the secret text string. You should see something like this:
    <br/>
    <img src="images/jwt-io3.jpg" style="width: 55vw; min-width: 330px;">
</div>
<div>
    Now you are very close!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Copy the JWT from the left side of jwt.io and, as before, carefully update your cookie in the Developer Tools window using this tampered JWT.
</div>
<br/>
<div>
    If everything went well, you can now get the flag here:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <a href="/get-flag" target="_blank">/get-flag</a>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
    It is possible, but unlikely, that your token will have expired if you took a long break somewhere during this process.  If that happens, just start all over again from the beginning.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    We hope this was a gentle introduction to JWTs. There are lots of resources online to learn more if you are interested.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here is at least one <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt" target="_blank">interesting article</a>.
