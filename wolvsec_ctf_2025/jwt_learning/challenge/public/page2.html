<div>
    You should have gotten these two JSON outputs from decoding the first two regions of the JWT:
    <pre>
    {"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}
    </pre>
    <pre>
    {"username":"sam","isAdmin":false,"iat":1738887694,"exp":1738889494}
    </pre>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
    The first JSON conveys which cryptographic signing algorithm was used to create the token.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The second JSON contains the "claims".  It says the <b>username</b> is <b>sam</b> and that they are not an admin. <b>iat</b> stands for "issued at" and <b>exp</b> stands for "expiration". These are date/time stamps but we won't worry about these for this challenge.
</div>

<div>
    To get your own JWT token, fill out the form below and submit it.
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<form id="form" method="GET" action="/get-token">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input id="username" type="text" name="username">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form></body>
